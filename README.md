IPS_ME_1&2_GNG_SPS_1.html file can be opened in any preferred web browser and represents a network created using the latest release of the fruit fly brain connectome. 
For this purpose, I used the file provided at https://codex.flywire.ai/api/download, which has been filtered to include only the Filtered synaptic connectivity table 
(5+ synapse threshold). From this file, I further filtered the data to retain only the upstream and downstream synapses of three neurons of interest, which have been previously 
characterized and are part of the flyâ€™s visual system. These neurons are identified as IPS.ME.1, IPS.ME.2, and GNG.SPS.1. Using the resulting edge list, available in this repository 
under the name Synapses_IPS_ME_1&2_GNG_SPS_1.tsv, I generated the visualization using the R programming language, employing the igraph and visNetwork packages.
